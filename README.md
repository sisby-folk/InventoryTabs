Tabs to swap between nearby screens like chests, crafting stations, and even entities.<br/>
Requires <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/connector">Connector</a> and <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api">FFAPI</a> on forge.<br/>
<i>Colloquially: Inventory Tabs 4</i>
</center>

While a supported handled screen is open, a paginated row of tabs is shown depicting nearby intractable blocks and entities.

By clicking on a tab, you'll instantly swap to the associated screen, carrying over any stacks.

Operates entirely on the client side, with a small improvement when on the server side to send anvil-changed chest names for tabs.

### Afterword

All mods are built on the work of many others - We're the fourth set of maintainers of this mod!<br/>
This version is a partial rewrite, following the work of CakeWhip, LiamMCW, and Andrew6rant.

This mod is included in [Tinkerer's Quilt](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt) - our modpack about rediscovering vanilla.

We're open to suggestions for how to implement stuff better - if you see something wonky and have an idea - let us know.
